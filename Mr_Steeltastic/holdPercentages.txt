HOLD PERCENTAGES FOR MR.STEELTASTIC (written by Caden, so blame me for the amazing format of this file)
-----------------

NO CONE:

GWABBA: -0.1075 (had issues when testing top motor, so like, be careful ig. we have it set to -0.1 rn in the code but it also had slight issues BUT it worked slightly better woo)

TOGHP: 0.193

MIDDE: -0.18 (side note: do not set the hold percentage to -0.95 by accident. this causes issues with the robot.)

BASS: -0.19 (yippee)
